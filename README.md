# Intro
Muddery is an online text game (such as MUD) server in Python. It bases on Evennia (https://github.com/evennia/evennia) which is a MUD/MU* creation system in Python. Muddery is licensed under [3-clause BSD license][license].

The target of Muddery is to provide a common online text game framework for game designers who should know little about programing.

The website http://www.muddery.org is under construction.
